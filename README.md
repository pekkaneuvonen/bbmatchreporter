# bbmatchreporter
(work in progress)

BBMatchreporter is a tool for storing the match data while playing tabletop Blood Bowl (a fantasy football game by Games Workshop). 

## The purpose
Playing the game regularly produces insane amounts of shabby papers, printed out team roster and reports, that serve no purpose in the long run. 

The initial aim of this web app was to help minimise the piles of paper waste.
When the structure was divided to the three stages of a game (pre-game -> game -> post-game) the idea of a single online-form kind of an app shifted towards a bit more functional tool. A clock was added for timing the turns and collecting the data was implemented to follow the actual events taking place during a game. Also the results of the most common dice checks were included under the hood to reduce the times you need to consult the result tables in the rule book.

## Work to be done
Next on the todo -list is implementing the user account and privileges functionality. All the report data is stored in a database but at the moment anyone can edit or delete the reports stored in the database.
